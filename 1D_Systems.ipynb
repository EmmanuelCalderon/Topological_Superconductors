        "From its definition, $P$ has only two eigenvalues, namely 0 and 1, and the same set of eigen wave functions as the original Hamiltonian. These properties allow us to interpret the correlation matrix as a \"Hamiltonian\" called the $C$-Hamiltonian with periodic boundary conditions. We can observe how the $C-$ hamiltonian of the subsystem keeps both of these eigenvalues and as we aproach $|v/w|\\rightarrow\\infty$ all of the eigenvalues tend to 0 or 1. However, when we cut the system and obtain the matrix $C$, we allow for the formation of new states of this \"hamiltonian\" in the regime $|v/w|<1$. So the question arises: how to interpret this new eigenstates?\n",

This is consistent with our previous calculations. Also, we can observe how these edge states tend to the bulk states $\\zeta_\\ell=0,1$ in pairs. That is, for every edge state with $\\zeta_\\ell>1/2$, there exists a partner with an eigenvalue equal to $1/2-\\zeta_\\ell$.
